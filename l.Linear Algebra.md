# features
- Lines remain lines
- Origin remains fixed  
##### so the grid lines will remain parallel and evenly spaced
# linear transformation
- linear transformation a function which vectors as inputs and outputs
- think it visually as stretching and squishing space
- it's determined by where the transformation takes the basic vectors of the space(in two dimensions is i hat and j hat)
- any other vector can be described as the linear comebination of those basis vectors
